# Obect_Detection
•keep the image in the directory where the source code file is kept. 
• please follow the opencv documentation to understand the meaning of the code_statements and many other concepts such as:
1. what is a color flag,
2. why image blurring is important, 2.1 using cv2.GaussianBLur,
3. why do we need to convert an image into HSV format,
4. how to find the HSV value of some specific color,
5. what is morphology in the context of computer vision,
6. how to use kernels in order to apply  morphology to the project,
7. How to find contours and write code for them
8. how to apply contours to the detected object.

This is my first Object Detection(OD) project using OpenCv, python. Using YOLO- you only look once- is the most preferable of doing the same these days. My next OD proect would be based on YOLO. 

YOLO Guys!!
